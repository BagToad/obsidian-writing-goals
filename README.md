# Obsidian Writing Goals
Set yourself dynamic writing goals for notes and folders to help you hit your long form writing targets with Obsidian.

This plugin provides a simplified version of a [goals feature available in Ulysses](https://help.ulysses.app/kb/guide/en/goals-3jzwhIUp5a). 

Long form text for the demos was created using [Delorean Ipsum](https://deloreanipsum.com/).

## Adding a goal
You can either add a goal by using the context menu in the file explorer for any note or folder in your vault.

For notes, and entry will be added to the frontmatter of your note with the word goal. The name for the frontmatter property is `word-goal` by default (also used by the awesome [Novel word count plugin](https://github.com/isaaclyman/novel-word-count-obsidian) by @isaaclyman). You can change the property name in the plugin settings.

There is also a command to add a goal for any note or folder in your vault.

## Updating a goal
You can update goals in 3 ways:
1. Using the add/update command.
2. Using the file explorer context menu item.
3. For notes only, updating the value of the goal frontmatter property.

## Viewing goals
You can view the goal set for the current note or for any file or folder using a couple of commands:

Goal progress should update in real-time as you type. Text added to any file within a folder with a goal (including folders within folders, recursively) will go towards that goal.
