Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. 

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Who's are these? What did your mother ever see in that kid? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Don't tell me anything. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'll get it back to you, alright? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. What?

Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? No, bastards. We do now. Leave her alone, you bastard. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

I'll get it back to you, alright? George, help me, please. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Next, please. Huh?

C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. He's your brother, Mom. This sounds pretty heavy. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. What's a rerun? Yeah, gimme a Tab. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.

Doc. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Now Biff, don't con me. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Breakfast. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Uh, well, I gotta go.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Keys? Yeah, gimme a Tab. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

Alright, I'm ready. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yet. Calvin. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.

What's that thing he's on? Mom, is that you? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. No. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Do you mind if we park for a while? Maybe you were adopted.
