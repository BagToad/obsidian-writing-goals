This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.

It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. No, why, what's a matter? Alright, punk, now- Without any sugar. Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

Excuse me. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

Yeah. Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George? Sit here, Marty. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Don't tell me anything.

He's a very strange young man. Hello. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. You okay, is everything alright? Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine. Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside- Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.

Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Now Biff, don't con me. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Alright, punk, now- Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein.

Ah well, sort of. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Yeah, I think maybe you do. My insurance, it's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

We all make mistakes in life, children Doc. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life. He's a peeping tom. Dad.

Nothing's coming to my mind. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Who is that guy. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Maybe you were adopted. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? What, what, ma?

Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Perfect, just perfect. Maybe you were adopted. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas... Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

C'mon. Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. C'mon, c'mon. Oh. Jesus, you smoke too?

Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Hello. I followed you. It's safe now. Everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. Science Fiction Theater.

Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Is she pretty? Who is that guy. Welcome to my latest experiment. It's the one I've been waiting for all my life.

Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. What's a rerun? Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. That's good advice, Marty. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head?

Yeah, he's right here. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. That's George McFly. George, aren't you gonna kiss me? Thank you. In about thirty years.

C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Really. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Who's are these? What did your mother ever see in that kid? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Don't tell me anything. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'll get it back to you, alright? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. What?

Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? No, bastards. We do now. Leave her alone, you bastard. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

I'll get it back to you, alright? George, help me, please. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Next, please. Huh?

C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. He's your brother, Mom. This sounds pretty heavy. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. What's a rerun? Yeah, gimme a Tab. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.

Doc. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Now Biff, don't con me. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Breakfast. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Uh, well, I gotta go.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Keys? Yeah, gimme a Tab. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

Alright, I'm ready. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yet. Calvin. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.

What's that thing he's on? Mom, is that you? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. No. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Do you mind if we park for a while? Maybe you were adopted.
