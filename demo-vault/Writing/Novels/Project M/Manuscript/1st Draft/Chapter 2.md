Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? No, why, what's a matter? C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? This sounds pretty heavy.

Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Leave me alone. Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Ahh. Ahh. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them. Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. What Lorraine, what? Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody.

What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?

Ah. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. Never? Yeah. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

Quiet. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.

Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. I have to tell you about the future. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. Yeah, gimme a Tab. Oh, great scott. You get the cable, I'll throw the rope down to you.

Okay, but I don't know what to say. Whoa, wait, Doc. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. What the hell is this?

Ah. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? No, I refuse to except the responsibility. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it. George.

Are you okay? Watch it, Goldie. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him. Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?

Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Whoa, wait, Doc. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Uh?

What? Doc. On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

Doc. Okay. Jennifer. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Uh, well, I gotta go.

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Who's are these? What did your mother ever see in that kid? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Don't tell me anything. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'll get it back to you, alright? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. What?

Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? No, bastards. We do now. Leave her alone, you bastard. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

I'll get it back to you, alright? George, help me, please. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Next, please. Huh?

C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. He's your brother, Mom. This sounds pretty heavy. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything.

No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin. What's a rerun? Yeah, gimme a Tab. And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.

Doc. This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing? A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Now Biff, don't con me. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Breakfast. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Uh, well, I gotta go.

I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Keys? Yeah, gimme a Tab. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

Alright, I'm ready. So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. Yet. Calvin. Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.

What's that thing he's on? Mom, is that you? Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. No. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. Do you mind if we park for a while? Maybe you were adopted.

Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Who's are these? What did your mother ever see in that kid? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Don't tell me anything. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'll get it back to you, alright? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. What?
