Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Who's are these? What did your mother ever see in that kid? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Don't tell me anything. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? I'll get it back to you, alright? Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. What?

Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. Well yeah, you know we have two of them. Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? No, bastards. We do now. Leave her alone, you bastard. Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model, I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

I'll get it back to you, alright? George, help me, please. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born. Next, please. Huh?
